These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft
•	updates,
•	supplements, and
•	support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.
By using the software you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software.
If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.
1.	SCOPE OF RIGHTS.
a.	License Grant.  You may only use the software for non-commercial or research purposes.  You may not modify the software for any purpose. Examples of non-commercial uses are teaching, academic research, public demonstrations and personal experimentation.
b.	Publication. You may publish (or present papers or articles) on your results from using the software, provided that no material portion of the software is included in any such publication or presentation. 
2. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS: 
a. If you distribute the Software, you will distribute them under the same terms and conditions as in this license, and you will not grant other rights to the Software or derivative works that are different from those provided by this MSR-LA.  
b. If you have created derivative works of the software, and distribute such derivative works, you will cause the modified files to carry prominent notices so that recipients know that they are not receiving the original software.

2.	TERM; TERMINATION The term of this license will commence upon your acceptance of these license terms and will continue indefinitely unless terminated as provided herein. If you breach this agreement or if you sue anyone over patents that you think may apply to or read on the software or anyone's use of the software, this agreement (and your license and rights obtained herein) terminate automatically. If this agreement is terminated, you must return or destroy all full or partial copies of the software in your possession immediately.  Any sections that are intended to survive termination of this agreement shall survive.

You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.
4.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.
